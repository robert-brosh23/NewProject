## NewProject
A new project using raylib

# Compiling and Running
1. Create a new file in the NewProject directory called 'game.exe'.
    - If this doesn't work, create 'game.exe' in the 'vscode' folder, then move it out into 'NewProject'.
2. Make sure the 'game.exe' tab is open.
3. Run the 'Start Debugging' command (or press F5).

Generally as long as the game.exe file is open and empty, your changes will come through when you compile.
