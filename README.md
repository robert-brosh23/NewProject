# ProjectStainedGlass
A new project using raylib

## Compiling and Running
1. Create a new file in the NewProject directory called 'game.exe'.
    - If this doesn't work, create 'game.exe' in the 'vscode' folder, then move it out into 'NewProject'.
2. Make sure the 'game.exe' tab is open.
3. Run the 'Start Debugging' command (or press F5).

### Alternatively, if the 'game.exe' tab is open and has characters written in it follow these steps for a shortcut:
1. Select all text in 'game.exe' using ctrl+a, and delete.
2. Save 'game.exe'.
3. Make sure the 'game.exe' tab is open when you compile your code.

Generally as long as the game.exe file is open and empty, your changes will come through when you compile.
